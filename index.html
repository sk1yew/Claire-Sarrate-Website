            <p>There are a lot of things I like and I don't like. I like to have fun with my friends. I like to play online games. I love watching movies or animes but what I really love is jokes. Sometimes I tell joke but sometimes I do joke. The things that I don't like are okras...( I really hate okra). Another thing that I don't like is ampalaya, for me it tastes horrible. So far I have told you about things I don't like about food, now I am going to tell you one of the biggest things I hate in this world...to be BORED!! Just saying this word makes me sick. Like I told you before there are a lot of things I like and some things I really don't like.</p>

            <p class="education-skill-description">Well by now you might know some of my personality but I am going to tell you some more. I think some good points of my personality are that I am musical, very joking, sometimes brave, friendly when its time to meet friends and quite online gamer since I like a bunch of online games. I am also funny when it is my time to do my jokes. I haven't told you one of my bad points yet.. some of my bad points are that I am a little bit forgetful, well let's say I am quite forgetful. I am disorganized, I get angry easy sometimes.. Well each person has their own personality.</p>
